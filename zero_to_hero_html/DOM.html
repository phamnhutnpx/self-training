<!-- What is the DOM?
The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.

The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows "programs and scripts" to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

Core DOM - standard model for all document types
XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents -->
